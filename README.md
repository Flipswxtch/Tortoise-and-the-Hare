# Tortoise and the Hare
This is a fun take on using Turtle graphics. Outcome of the program is based on the classic story of
The Tortoise and the Hare - slow and steady wins the race. 

The file titled race.py was my initial program and is based on content from Chapter 9 of the book "Head First Learn To Code". The refactored version adds comments and documentation. The code itself, while doing the same thing as before, has been reworked by myself and a few others from The Central Ohio Python Users Group. Thank you to the group who helped make my code more readable and accessible! The group can be accessed through this link: https://www.meetup.com/Central-Ohio-Python-Users-Group
